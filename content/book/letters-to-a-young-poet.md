This isn't a book per se but rather a collection of letters that Rainer Maria Rilke wrote Franz Kappus, a 19 year old
young man who was about to go to the army.

The whole collection is available [online](https://www.carrothers.com/rilke_main.htm).

### How I discovered it?

It's no secret that there are companies building cyber weapons that are then used by governments and three-letter
agencies around the world to spy on the people, including their own citizens. One of these companies was the
[Hacking Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team) which got, well, hacked and all of their tools and emails
were exposed to the public. The person(s) behind it was [Phineas Phisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Fisher).

Several years later that same person exposed the accounts of a Cayman Bank along with the detailed
[description](https://github.com/Alekseyyy/phineas-philes/blob/master/cayman-english.md) of how the hack was conducted.
Inside the document were the references to several of the books that are in this queue.
