## Impressions

I enjoyed listening to this book. It keeps you hooked to the story and has several plot twists.

### How I discovered it?

It was suggested by the audiobook app that I use. After listening to too many self-development books I decided to
take a break and enjoy some fiction. And why not listen to a novel with a good rating.

## Summary + Notes

Apart from an interesting narration that I thoroughly enjoyed, the story is told by 3 women living in the same small
town in Northern France, one thing that really caught my mind and made have goosebumps is the description of a murder.
An 11 year old child killed his fellow classmate. The horror in the victim's eyes perfectly described by the author,
and the smile on the face of the killer brought the movie [City Of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_God_(2002_film))
to my memories.
