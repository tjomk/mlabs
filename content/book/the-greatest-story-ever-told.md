## The book in 3 sentences

1. The history of scientific discoveries is very exciting and is built on the work of hundreds of people. Einstein
didn't come up with his theories out of nowhere, he was standing on the shoulders of others before him. So did Faraday,
Curie, Feynman, and every other scientist.

### How I discovered it?

It was a recommendation from the e-bookstore while I was purchasing books by David Deutsch. Having known and watched
many of Lawrence's talks, I couldn't miss the opportunity to buy this book.

## How it changed me

In my [August 2021](https://rtjom.com/blog/2021/08/summary-august-2021/) update I mentioned how this book made me
excited by the way physicists can come up with hypotheses on our Universe and use maths to describe them. A multi-dimensional
Universe? Here you go. A 2D hologram on the verge of a black hole? Maths seem to work out. This is realization made
me as excited as seeing the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy.
