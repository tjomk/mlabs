I love fermentation. You get to see, and more importantly to taste, the byproducts of bacteria, something you cannot
see with your naked eye. It still feels magical even though I understand some of the processes involved in it. After
experimenting with bread baking for almost 3 years (on and off for prolonged periods), and blindly following the recipes,
I decided I want to dig deeper into the topic. Without that understanding it's almost impossible to figure out what
caused a bad texture or weird taste in the final product. And where else to start than with a sourdough starter?

In Estonia the most popular (or rather wide-spread) flour producer is [Tartu Mill](https://tartumill.ee/). I've been
using their flour most of the time, and it worked well. I do plan to start experimenting with other producers, but so
far two of my starters have been made from their flour.

My first starter has been made with a mix of wholegrain and all-purpose wheat flours and 100% hydration. This starter
was really quick to kick off (which took about a week to get a healthy stable rise), and over the course of my experiments
I've started it several times. Because the type of starter influences the final result a lot, I wanted to experiment
with different flour types. Two of the most famous local bakeries, [Karjase Sai](https://www.instagram.com/karjasesai/)
and [RÃ˜ST](https://www.instagram.com/rostpagar/) both use all-purpose flour for their starters which influenced my
choise too.
