This one is very late, and since yet again I haven't taken any notes of what's been happening in December, I have already
forgotten everything. To be frank, there hasn't been much to talk about either with one notable exception: I was asleep
at 11 in the evening.

I also started taking more daily notes of some thoughts using Day One app on the phone. I was sold by the reminder feature.
One day when my younger child was particularly bad during the night, and as a result I was badly deprived of sleep the
following day. At first I wanted to erase that memory from my head, but then decided that instead I want to get reminded
of how bad it was the previous year so that I could enjoy the moment I'll be in a year's time (hopefully). And that
is how I started journalling almost daily now.
