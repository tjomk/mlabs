It's been 6 months since I started it semi-actively. Between work, two kids, and all of the isolation I've managed to
find maybe an hour of time every month to work on it. That doesn't bother me much as I didn't set any deadline
expectations, but from time to time I still sigh and think about it.

A while ago I had a chat with a friend who told me the following:

> Instead of measuring the absolute time from the start of the project to the end, track the active time you work on it

And this changed everything, including motivation. Now instead of working on it for 6 months without pretty much any
progress, I know I've spent just 3 total hours on it with very visible progress.

If you're juggling multiple long-term projects, track the time you spend on them, just like you'd do freelancing for
different clients.
