Few years ago there was a [mass-shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack) in San Bernardino.
FBI seized the phone of one of the shooters and asked Apple to decrypt it. Apple refused citing the protection of its
users not matter what. Ask any person on the street or among your friends who is right here, and the would most likely
side with the FBI. After all, a person who massacred 14 people by definition cannot have the right to privacy.

Let's take another example: a group of friends plan a heist and share the details via IM (instant messaging) app. Eventually
they get caught, and the FBI asks the IM company to hand over the chat history of these people, or hand them over the
encryption keys. What would you do? Again, for the majority of responders the answer is pretty clear: open up the chats,
and hand them over to the government.

And one last example: one person falls in love with another one. At first they talk over the Internet, discuss their
future plans, share photos. Police arrests both of them, seizes their computers and phones. What did they do wrong?
They're both of the same sex. And sadly, majority of the countries in the world do still dictate who you should have
sex with, what food you should consume, and what can you do with your body. As recent as the last year (2020), a new
legislation in Poland and Russia tried to heavily limit or outright ban the abortion, which by the way is still illegal
in many countries and some states in US.

The problem gets even more blurry when you consider political opinion, and what precedent governments can use in order
to prosecute people they deem are a threat to their law and order. I wanted to write about algorithms that Facebook,
Google, and other large tech companies use. How can this be related to privacy and prosecuting criminals? Showing
personalized ads doesn't harm you, and having targeted advertising might be actually useful for people. I will get to this
in a bit, but before let me also mention one Facebook experiment.

In 2014 it became known that Facebook's data science team conducted an experiment where they manipulated the emotions
of 689003 of their users. People became outraged because they were being manipulated without giving their consent. In 7
years that have passed since the experiment, their data science team has grown in size and improtance. And most likely
Facebook has learned to stay more quite about conducting controversial experiments. And so did Google, Amazon, and many
other companies that gather a lot of data about their users. The advertising industry has done a huge leap in the past
20 years from a simple department to having PhD students and whole university departments researching how to make us do
what we are told. These days this branch of science is called neuromarketing.

Today these companies have amassed so much information about us that now they know better who we are than we do. They
get the subtle clues and can tell me whether you have a depression, if you're planning to quit your job, or even
commit suicide. These companies can learn about your sexual orientation much earlier than you yourself figure this out.
Now let's consider a hypothetical situation where Google uses their powerful algorithm to show your ads with the human
models of your sex. Because you're gay (even though you don't know it yet), you're more likely to buy these brands
when they're advertised not by beautiful women, but instead by beautiful men. If we take this not so hypothetical
example further, what if you were outright advertised gay products while browsing the Internet even though you haven't
previously visited any of the website with that content. And with some countries
[pushing hard](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/chrome-firefox-and-safari-updated-to-block-kazakhstan-government-spying/)
to sniff their people's Internet traffic one way or another, the government might learn about your sexual orientation
simply by watching which products you are advertised. Now remember that in some countries same-sex relationship is
outright forbidden and can lead to death penalty.

One might say that this is not possible, and all of this is hypothetical. And I do hope it is. But whenever people say
they have nothing to hide, or that criminals do not have any rights, I become angry. Because like in Nazi Germany,
it's not going to be long before all of the political parties are outlawed and you become a criminal too.
