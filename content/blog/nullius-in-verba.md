While this is not a full blog post, I wanted to remember the motto of the Royal Society:
"[Nullius in Verba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba)" which in Latin means "Take nobody's word for it". 

These days this phrase is more important than ever and critical thinking seems to be the lot of minority as neither
schools nor universities teach that.
