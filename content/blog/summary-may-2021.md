### Birthday celebration

My last birthday celebration happened when I was 17 years old. I must say that the last as it was organized by me where
I actually invited friends to come. Since then my friends and family did congratulate me, and did celebrate it with me
every year, but it was always triggered by them, not me. I have a weird relationship to this "special" day which feels
nothing special for me. In fact, only my mum celebrates her own birthday, but not my dad nor my sister. And I think that
had an impact on me too: why bother? What's so special about this day? Well, this year I changed my mind. Actually, it
was my wife who suggested to invite friends over, and I did.

It was a weird feeling to see a diverse group of people interact with each other. A physicist working with nano tech in
the semi-conductor industry, and IT project manager, and IT product owner, a sales and project manager for electrical
shields. Unfortunately two more people couldn't come, but it was fun anyway. I was always afraid of the chemistry that
would be among people with different backgrounds and interests. And what I've learned is that alcohol helps smooth it
out which leads to some interesting conversations.

Overall it was a fun day with everyone saying I should make it a tradition.

### Time-off in Turkey

Since the pandemic first hit we lost two trips to it. One to Israel, and another one to Switzerland and Italy. Our friends
from Russia were planning to go to Turkey in the beginning of May, and we decided to join to spend the time together.

I never wanted to go to Egypt or Turkey for the fact that these countries are strongly associated with all-inclusive
hotels and drunk people. Yet two years ago we visited such a place in Egypt, and now were heading to a similar place
in Turkey.

A week before leaving Russia has banned all travel to Turkey, so we were left there alone. Our whole trip lasted 12 days
out of which:

- 2 days were spent on logistics
- 3 nights in Antalya apartment hotel
- 5 nights in all-inclusive hotel near Antalya
- 3 nights in Istanbul

Travelling with two young kids is hard, especially when one has his teeth growing, and the other is allergic to Sun.
It's also hard because children need 2-3 days to get used to a new place, and during that time they might not sleep
well, continuously complain about everything, feel tired. And this reduced the real holiday to just a few days, three,
to be precise.

My opinion of the fancy hotel is that it is just a cover for a prison. Your schedule revolves around the breakfast,
lunch, and dinner times. You plan your activities in between these. Inside the hotel it's a fake paradise, outside it's
just a desert with nothing to see or do. Yet, children love these because you have a schedule and it's predictable. Both
me and my wife love the opposite: we love going new places every few days, we love a bit of randomness, and most of all
we love freedom.

The last three days were in Istanbul, and I totally fell in love with the city. Even though there was a lockdown (which
luckily didn't affect tourists) and all the museums were closed, most of the cafes and restaurants too, I enjoying walking
in the old town, seeing the Bosphorus, and imagining what it was like in the Ottoman times.

### Mathematics

About 3 or 4 years ago I started thinking about getting back to studies. Not just an online course but rather taking
time off the work and going to university. The reasons these thoughts came to be is because the job I was (and still am)
doing is not that brain-intensive. There is quite a lot to the joke that modern web development is just copy-pasting
code snippets from Stack Overflow. Learning new code patterns and applying them, or fixing a CSS so that your UI can
work in every browser doesn't involve much thinking, it's just reading blogs, computer science books and articles, or
Googling a solution to a known problem. This made me crave for some brain-intensive tasks and lead me to a journey trying
to figure out what I want to learn.

Math and physics were the obvious choices. Not because chemistry, astronomy, or other parts of the science are less
intensive, but for those subjects I would need to start from the very beginning and brush up all my high-school knowledge.
Having friends who studied both physics and maths as their major in universities, I talked to all of them to find out
what would interest me more, and in the end I ended up settling for maths.

Mathematics is the foundation of everything. This is the language that one can use to describe almost anything in the
real world. Building your physics knowledge of top of that would be much easier. And even though Faraday could make
amazing discoveries without the use of maths, I'm not him.

I started looking for various ways to get a proper degree in maths. Researched local universities in Estonia, checked
some [online](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22853921) opportunities. In the end life (with two kids and a startup)
came in the way, and so I paused the research. My itching for intense brain activity hasn't disappeared. And
even though I do not have the luxury of taking a sabbatical and going to university, I decided that I should do my best
and complete several online courses to at least refresh my knowledge. And so I signed up for the [Calculus](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-18.01x-single-variable-calculus)
course on edX which starts in June.
