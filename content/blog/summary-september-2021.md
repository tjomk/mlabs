September was all about job interviews and a bit of travelling.

### Job

After being out of the job market for nearly a decade (I got jobs via personal connections), this month I started
actively looking for work. It's a weird feeling because all those years I've been interviewing people myself, and
now I had to switch sides.

Turns out we currently live in the golden age of software engineering jobs where every developer can almost auction
themselves for potential employers.

Going through the interview process and finding a job. Also making shipit a side project

### Music

- half of the month spent listening to classical orchestra music and Operas
- the second half spent listening to old school bands like Nirvana, Muse, Guns N' Roses
