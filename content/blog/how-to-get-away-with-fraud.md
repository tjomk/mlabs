> The book describes a particularly sophisticated sting: “Arafat’s money man, Muhammad Rashid, was invited to a South American country, where an investment firm was founded with that country’s cooperation. It had luxurious offices and young, beautiful secretaries. Rashid was very impressed and decided to invest in the company. The return was very high, and he convinced Arafat to invest more and more money. The return increased, as he had expected, and he was promised fat commissions from the investment. Rashid and Arafat trusted their partners, and their appetites grew.
