### Public speaking

Probably the biggest event for me this month was me speaking on the local meetup. It's been almost 2 years since
I took public speaking course, and thanks to all of the lockdowns I haven't been able to practice these skills.
After much hesitation I have sent the proposal and got accepted.

### An interesting newsletter

I don't subscribe to email newsletters often. In fact, I'm just subscribed to only few, but this month via a recommendation
I 
receive a lot of newsletters, and prefer to read blogs via [Telegram](https://rtjom.com/blog/2021/03/telegram-is-the-new-rss-reader/).

### Physics and maths

As I'm slowly going through [The Greatest Story Ever Told](https://rtjom.com/book/the-greatest-story-ever-told-so-far/)
by Lawrence Krauss, I keep getting amazed by how scientists work, think, and make new discoveries. While the modern-day
science might be a bit different from the one we had 50-100 years ago, I think the process of coming up with new ideas
and approaches to solving problem is still the same: maths and imagination. It all starts with the question "What if?".

You might have heard of Paul Dirac in school physics classes. He has been trying to describe the behaviour of electron,
the particle that is orbiting the nucleus of an atom, and eventually came with the famous [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation)
which among other things could explain energy levels of electrons. Dirac's equations worked great, however there were
some caveats, namely maths predicted the existence of other particles yet unknown to science. This particle later
became the positron.

Another captivating story is about the string theory. Without going into too many technical details (and how many people
were, and still are, involved in this theory), the history of how it came to be is rather interesting: what if all the
matter in the Universe consists of small vibrating strings. Not the atoms. Not the protons and neutrons. Not even quarks.
But instead tiny strings. And depending how these strings vibrate you get different particles. Now that you have an idea,
you go and try to prove it mathematically. And this is how scientists came up with 11-dimension Universe in its latest
revision called the [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory).

What left me in awe after reading about many of the scientific discoveries is that you can use maths to describe any
crazy world that we might live in. Of course if the equations work out in the end. There's no experimental proof to
M-theory, but the math is there, and it means people can visualize such structure of the Universe in their heads.
We can also mathematically describe [parallel worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation).
Or that we're just a [2-dimensional hologram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space).
