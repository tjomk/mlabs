Hello, my name is Artjom (which is pronounced as "artiom").

I am technical co-founder of [getshipit.com](https://www.getshipit.com) which is a tool to help product managers plan their roadmap and manage product lifecycle. At the moment of this writing (Feb 2020) we're still a tiny company where I'm involved in everything: from writing code to customer support, advertising, planning.

[Elm Bits](https://elmbits.com) is my weekly email with everything about the Elm programming language. I started that as a way to learn more about the language and functional programming in general.

This website is my personal space to share thoughts and ideas about life and travel. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using modified [Lithium theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme/).

I occasionally post to [twitter](https://twitter.com/tjomk).
