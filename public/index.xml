      <description>The book in 3 sentences  The history of scientific discoveries is very exciting and is built on the work of hundreds of people. Einstein didn&amp;rsquo;t come up with his theories out of nowhere, he was standing on the shoulders of others before him. So did Faraday, Curie, Feynman, and every other scientist. One of the biggest reasons driving scientist is the desire to figure uncover the ways nature works We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to connect the three main forces into a single theory, but gravity still evades it.</description>

      <description>Work It&amp;rsquo;s been two months now since I&amp;rsquo;ve started worked full-time in another place while also supporting and continuing to build shipit. Having a new job is already stressful enough, but having two jobs in addition to a family with two children is&amp;hellip; Well, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard.
On my new job I&amp;rsquo;m learning a completely tech stack on top of a fairly complicated business logic. The last time I felt useless like that was about 8 or so years ago when I joined another startup and just moved from developing small websites in PHP to working on a big monolith in Python.</description>

      <description>October was the first month when I had to leave full-time development of shipit and move to another job. I am now a product engineer at Salv which helps companies beat financial crime. As unfortunately happens with many startups, shipit somewhat failed financially. In the past year being the only full-time employee also had its toll on me: depression and anxiety, personal pressure to improve the situation. After almost 7 years of remote work I now go to the office, have small talk and very deep and insightful conversation, walk way more, and overall have a happier life.</description>

      <description>A while ago I went to the movie theater to see Dune. I quite liked the film but wasn&amp;rsquo;t blown away by it. In school I played the game on my Sega Mega Drive. However after the cinema experience I had the itch to read the novel and learn more about the characters. After all, there are a lot of important things that are in the book but are always missing from the screen adaptation.</description>

      <description>The book in 3 sentences  Explore your local environment. There are way more edible plants just next to your home than you can imagine.

      <description>September was all about job interviews and a bit of travelling.
Job After being out of the job market for nearly a decade (I got jobs via personal connections), this month I started actively looking for work. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling because all those years I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing people myself, and now I had to switch sides. Turns out we currently live in the golden age of software engineering jobs where every developer can almost auction themselves for potential employers.</description>

      <description>While this is not a full blog post, I wanted to remember the motto of the Royal Society: &amp;ldquo;Nullius in Verba&amp;rdquo; which in Latin means &amp;ldquo;Take nobody&amp;rsquo;s word for it&amp;rdquo;.
These days this phrase is more important than ever and critical thinking seems to be the lot of minority as neither schools nor universities teach that.</description>

      <description>Public speaking Probably the biggest event for me this month was me speaking on the local developers meetup. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 2 years since I took public speaking course, and thanks to all of the lockdowns I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to practice these my skills. After much hesitation I sent the proposal and it got accepted.
Having gone through the learning part before, I prepared the slide deck, the story, came up with some jokes, and practiced several times in front of the family and one of the organizers.</description>

      <description>Flyboarding Probably the most memorable event of July was me trying flyboarding. It&amp;rsquo;s a type of water sports where you put your legs into a board with two pipes that blast water. This water is pumped through the pipe connected to a water jet, and as a result you can hover over the water.
 Before the event I was somewhat nervous: who wants to spend 20-25 minutes constantly falling into the water?</description>

      <description>Math course A while ago I have signed up for an online Maths course. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about getting back to university to study maths for the past 2-3 years, and eventually decided to refresh the knowledge by taking the free course. It started in June and after the initial assignment I dropped out. Why?
The curriculum is really interesting, and so are the teachers. In the first week I spent about an hour every day to go through the problems, and while sad to admit it, I simply do not have enough time right now.</description>

      <description>These days paper is not the only medium one can use to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; books. There are e-book readers like Kindle. There are audio books from services like Audible. There are apps on the phone to read books. And there are apps which can read you e-books. So saying that you&amp;rsquo;ve just read a book might not be technically correct which is why I opted to used the word &amp;ldquo;consume&amp;rdquo;.
I have my books in 3 different mediums:</description>

      <description>Birthday celebration My last birthday celebration happened when I was 17 years old. I must say that the last as it was organized by me where I actually invited friends to come. Since then my friends and family did congratulate me, and did celebrate it with me every year, but it was always triggered by them, not me. I have a weird relationship to this &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; day which feels nothing special for me.</description>

      <description>April wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much different from March, however few events worth mentioning.
Coffee machine I bought an espresso machine. For a person who hated coffee his entire life this is a big thing. I never understood the obsession with which people drink it. Occasionally I forced myself to drink it during some social meetings or when I needed to work but was about to fall asleep. And every time it was cappuccino with lots of sugar to hide the taste of coffee.</description>

      <description>With Google killing its Reader an era ended for me. I loved its old design and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get used to the new alternatives. As a result, I stopped reading blogs via RSS for some time. There was also a problem of information overload: too many new posts, sort of like an infinite scroll in Facebook or Instagram.
Eventually a lot of interesting people I follow started creating channels in Telegram. And as of today, Telegram has become a de-facto social network and news aggregator for me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 6 months since I started it semi-actively. Between work, two kids, and all of the isolation I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find maybe an hour of time every month to work on it. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me much as I didn&amp;rsquo;t set any deadline expectations, but from time to time I still sigh and think about it.
A while ago I had a chat with a friend who told me the following:</description>

      <description>I was hesitating whether I should write anything for March or not. In the end I decided to actually write a few lines. March was completely neutral. Nothing happened. Nothing worth mentioning. Just life. That&amp;rsquo;s it.</description>

      <description>I was hoping that the biggest event of February would be puppy school, but Covid took the lead bringing down both myself, and my whole family after me.
After months of light isolation and very few meetings with family and friends, I decided to go to a Krav Maga group training. It was hell of a physical training. Ten minutes after the start I could barely catch my breath, and only half an hour later after the warm-up was finished, I managed to sync my breathing.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I keep hearing the phrase &amp;ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&amp;rdquo;, yet I have never actually thought about its origins and meaning. In &amp;ldquo;Meditations: a new translation&amp;rdquo; Gregory Hays mentioned that event and explains it. Here is an exerpt from Wikipedia:
 Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s crossing the Rubicon river in January 49 BC precipitated the Roman Civil War, which ultimately led to Caesar becoming dictator and the rise of the imperial era of Rome.</description>

      <description>The moment I stop taking notes and leave writing this blog post for a week or two, all my memories of the past month events vanish. Partly this is because nothing big happens, and the life is pretty much the same. With a young kid every day is almost a groundhog day. Luckily, I can point out few events that made this month stand out a bit&amp;hellip;
About 5 years ago I moved back to Tallinn from London and decided to start a honey business.</description>

      <description>Last week I launched shipit (a tool for product managers to help plan and manage their product) on Product Hunt for the second time. I hesitated whether I should do it or not, but the results were very unexpected.
I spent nearly two weeks preparing the first round, reading about the timing, the importance of famous hunters, your first comment, and the support of community. I failed to find someone to hunt us, so did it myself.</description>

      <description>Few years ago there was a mass-shooting in San Bernardino. FBI seized the phone of one of the shooters and asked Apple to decrypt it. Apple refused citing the protection of its users not matter what. Ask any person on the street or among your friends who is right here, and the would most likely side with the FBI. After all, a person who massacred 14 people by definition cannot have the right to privacy.</description>

      <description>It looks like December has been the most fruitful and event-rich month of the year.
Dog I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a dog, and about 4 years when I realized things are going sour with my finances, and the investments I made are going to require most of my money, I had to put the idea of owning a dog away. Since few months ago after I got rid of that project, the thought of owning a dog started to become more real.</description>

      <description>Another monthly update that I wanted to write in the beginning of the month before forgetting everything. Life with two small kids is becoming more and more complicated.
Funny how the opinion on 1 vs 2 kids changes from meh, that&amp;rsquo;s easy, and I have lots of energy and free time, and we can have a third kid in the first month. Then in the second month things start to settle down and you have less energy, but still capable of following all your life activities like sports, hobbies, etc.</description>

      <description>What happens when something drags you for so long that you forget what the normal life looks like? When you have a constant buzz in your ear, or a never-ending pain in the shoulder, you get used to living with that. Likewise I got involved in an extremely bad investment 5 years ago that changed the course of my life considerably.
I got invited by a family friend to participate in a project, and I approved of it to one of my close family members.</description>

      <description>When you miss the deadline for writing a regular blog post and haven&amp;rsquo;t left any notes, it becomes really hard to remember what happend in that month. Nothing special, I guess, since I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much. But here are a few notes&amp;hellip;
My RC car project got stalled for quite a while for various reasons. After disassembling the chassis I started modelling new motor mounts to support a motor for each wheel.</description>

      <description>Having your first child changes everything in life. Eventually you adapt to the new lifestyle. New habits develop. You learn to better plan your time if you want some personal space. Then the second child arrives and everything changes again. You go through the same process again. I kind of expected it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know in which way. In every way!
Having a second child was a huge event in August, but there are other things that happened as well: August ended with me doing sports for two months.</description>

      <description>July has been another interesting month in my startup life. My co-founder has moved back to his home country leaving me alone in Estonia. Not that it&amp;rsquo;s a big deal and means an end to our company, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a bit of a blow to the social part of the company. Now it became remote-only with all three co-founders spread across Europe.
We haven&amp;rsquo;t had any new customers in July, but I started turning more attention to marketing and sales.</description>

      <description>My sports habits continued in June and I have been going to the climbing gym throughout the whole month. As a result my climbing problem skills went from the simple 1-3 (using French grading system) to starting doing 4-grade problems. Each session is followed up with some fitness excersizes. It helps to train with a buddy as you are constantly pushed to rest less, train more, and climb increasingly more complex routes.</description>

      <description>May saw the relaxing of the quarantine rules, and at the beginning of the month restaurants started to open up. We went to one and were the only people there.
While I was in high school I used to ride a dirt bike. These were fun times and in the process I made some good friends and broke a few bones and had several brain concussions. This bike was in my parents&#39; garage since then, until I sold it few weeks ago.</description>

      <title>Why you shouldn&#39;t become an angel investor</title>

      <description>For many people like me, angel investing is akin to being a pirate. You sail the vast seas in search of the Urca de Lima of startups. Every encounter with the navy ship (the WeWork of our time) can cause you your life,get decapitated, or your team turns against you and leave on a deserted island with just a single bottle of rum. But every once in a while some pirate (which could be you) hit that cargo ship with gold bullion.</description>

      <description>April was the second month of the pandemic and lockdowns here in Estonia. We were already staying at home since the end of February, so not much has changed. It took a way longer than I hoped for to adapt to the new work-life balance. As a result, I moved to a somewhat flexible working hours, several smaller chunks with longer breaks instead of a one long 9-5 day. When you have two working adults and a toddler, it&amp;rsquo;s next to impossible to do deep work unless you wake up very early in the morning (which I don&amp;rsquo;t).</description>

      <description>Well, March and likely next few months are going to be all about the virus, self-isolation, and remote work. Both me and my wife have IT-related jobs which are easy to make remote. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working remotely for the past 5 years so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing new. What is different though is that our kiddo is also staying home with us, and it&amp;rsquo;s been nightmare&amp;rsquo;ish, to say the least.
In the past two weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve all been adapting to the new reality: trying to find time and space for some deep work, getting personal time and space outside work, and having enough ideas and games to get the toddler busy and entertained.</description>

      <description>Tallinn is divided into 8 districts which in turn are sub-divided into smaller parts. While everyone who lives in the city they were born think they know the place, tourists and expacts usually know way more. When I lived in London I loved to explore tiny villages that the city eventually consumed. When you arrive there the place still feels like a village. In a series of blog posts I want to explore my own city&amp;rsquo;s sub districts and map them here.</description>

      <description>Being a cold loving person I recently saw a temperature map of Europe showing that throughout the whole continent it&amp;rsquo;s above zero. To say that I was shocked is understatement.
 In my memory this is the first winter ever without any snow. Not only that, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got flowers blooming in February! Whenever I take my child to the kindergarten we count how many different types of flowers we spot.</description>

      <description>I work for a startup called Juggle Jobs. We’re the goto place to people to find flexible work.

      <title>Using Wtforms With Selectfield and Fieldlist</title>

      <description>WTForms is an amazing library that helps with the forms creation, validation, rendering. Instead of validating each field separately in your code, all you need to do is run form.validate().
SelectField Using WTForms is straightforward for most common fields, however when the use-case gets a bit complicated, the documentation is not of much help. Recently I had to create a project with a lot of dynamic fields and validation where I used SelectField, SelectMultipleField, and FieldList among others.</description>
