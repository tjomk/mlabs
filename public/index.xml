      <description>My sports habits continued in June and I have been going to the climbing gym throughout the whole month. As a result my climbing problem skills went from the simple 1-3 (using French grading system) to starting doing 4-grade problems. Each session is followed up with some fitness excersizes. It helps to train with a buddy as you are constantly pushed to rest less, train more, and climb increasingly more complex routes.</description>

      <description>May saw the relaxing of the quarantine rules, and at the beginning of the month restaurants started to open up. We went to one and were the only people there.
While I was in high school I used to ride a dirt bike. These were fun times and in the process I made some good friends and broke a few bones and had several brain concussions. This bike was in my parents&amp;rsquo; garage since then, until I sold it few weeks ago.</description>

      <title>Why you shouldn&#39;t become an angel investor</title>

      <description>For many people like me, angel investing is akin to being a pirate. You sail the vast seas in search of the Urca de Lima of startups. Every encounter with the navy ship (the WeWork of our time) can cause you your life,get decapitated, or your team turns against you and leave on a deserted island with just a single bottle of rum. But every once in a while some pirate (which could be you) hit that cargo ship with gold bullion.</description>

      <description>April was the second month of the pandemic and lockdowns here in Estonia. We were already staying at home since the end of February, so not much has changed. It took a way longer than I hoped for to adapt to the new work-life balance. As a result, I moved to a somewhat flexible working hours, several smaller chunks with longer breaks instead of a one long 9-5 day. When you have two working adults and a toddler, it&amp;rsquo;s next to impossible to do deep work unless you wake up very early in the morning (which I don&amp;rsquo;t).</description>

      <title>Summary March 2020</title>

      <description>Well, March and likely next few months are going to be all about the virus, self-isolation, and remote work. Both me and my wife have IT-related jobs which are easy to make remote. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working remotely for the past 5 years so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing new. What is different though is that our kiddo is also staying home with us, and it&amp;rsquo;s been nightmare&amp;rsquo;ish, to say the least.
In the past two weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve all been adapting to the new reality: trying to find time and space for some deep work, getting personal time and space outside work, and having enough ideas and games to get the toddler busy and entertained.</description>

      <title>A Walk Around Pelgulinn</title>

      <description>Tallinn is divided into 8 districts which in turn are sub-divided into smaller parts. While everyone who lives in the city they were born think they know the place, tourists and expacts usually know way more. When I lived in London I loved to explore tiny villages that the city eventually consumed. When you arrive there the place still feels like a village. In a series of blog posts I want to explore my own city&amp;rsquo;s sub districts and map them here.</description>

      <description>Being a cold loving person I recently saw a temperature map of Europe showing that throughout the whole continent it&amp;rsquo;s above zero. To say that I was shocked is understatement.
In my memory this is the first winter ever without any snow. Not only that, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got flowers blooming in February! Whenever I take my child to the kindergarten we count how many different types of flowers we spot. The last time it&amp;rsquo;s been galanthuses, coltsfoots, and leucojums.</description>

      <title>Using Wtforms With Selectfield and Fieldlist</title>

      <description>WTForms is an amazing library that helps with the forms creation, validation, rendering. Instead of validating each field separately in your code, all you need to do is run form.validate().
SelectField Using WTForms is straightforward for most common fields, however when the use-case gets a bit complicated, the documentation is not of much help. Recently I had to create a project with a lot of dynamic fields and validation where I used SelectField, SelectMultipleField, and FieldList among others.</description>
